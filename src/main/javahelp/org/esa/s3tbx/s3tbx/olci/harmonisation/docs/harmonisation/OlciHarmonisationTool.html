<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
    The OLCI Harmonisation Processor provides a 'harmonisation' of OLCI bands 13-15, which
    are the new bands in the O2A absorption line (764.4 and 767.5 nm) and the existing channel
    at 761.25nm. This harmonisation provides a modification of the effective transmittances
    to their values which would be measured at their mean wavelengths and with nominal bandwidth.
